# CustomerTransactionPred
The problem statement for this customer transaction prediction can be found at Kaggle named as 'Santander Customer Transaction Prediction'. The dataset of this contains a train and a test folder with total 200 features and 2,00,000 entries for both train and test sets. To solve this binary classification problem I have checked for duplicate entries and null entries as there were none I converted all the features into z score values and fed them to Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier. The train set was divided into train and validation set. Validation set was used to select different parameters like batch size, regularization and loss. Finaly the classifier was trained on the whole train set and test set features were used for predicting whether the transaction would be made or not.
